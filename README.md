- ðŸ‘‹ Heeyy guys, Iâ€™m @jvitorrr and today (22/08/2022) I made the decision to start learnig programming. 

- I already have a bachelor on Business Adminsitration and I'm currenting doing an MBA in Finance, but honestly it doesn't attract me anymore. So here I am.

- Sometimes I catch my self whatching too many tutorials, "how to become a programmer" videos but I never start really doing. But I intend to change that.

- I also don't know where to start, but I know that I want to work in the back end.

Well, that's it.
